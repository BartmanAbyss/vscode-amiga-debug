- Fixed WinUAE to reset debug resources on restart
- `Profile File Size` working again, now demangles C++ names
- bump IntelliSense to gnu11, g++20
- moved elf2hunk to a seperate repository, limit symbol length, C++ name demangling
- elf2hunk now suports `-s` to strip symbols (long symbol names can cause AmigaDOS to not load the exe file)
- fix crash in Shrinkler for empty symbol hunks
- better C++ support (added -fno-rtti -fcoroutines to CCFLAGS). Added <type_traits>, <coroutines> header files. support for global destructors (now using -fno-use-cxa-atexit)
- support for more Amiga models in `.vscode/launch.json` (these are all WinUAE quickstart configs):
  - `A1200-FAST`: A1200 with 4MB fast memory
  - `A1200-030`: A1200 with Blizzard 1230-IV and 32MB board memory. Requires the absolute path to the Blizzard ROM in `cpuboard`.
  - `A3000`: A3000 (no profiler support)
- new option `endcli` in `.vscode/launch.json` (default: false) If enabled, uses `run` and `EndCLI` in `startup-sequence` so you cann call `CloseWorkBench()` from your program.
- new option `uaelog` in `.vscode/launch.json` (default: true): If disabled, don't show WinUAE log output in debug console
- NDK: updated to latest version from bebbo's package
- GCC: prevent `sccp` pass from generating `__mulsi3` calls
- Fixed WinUAE not booting correctly after overwriting the default configuration
- debugger: now breaks at 'TRAP #7' opcode (generated by GCC when undefined behavior is encountered)
- debugger: now breaks at Address Error (68000 unaligned memory access)
- debugger: now breaks at Illegal Instruction (illegal opcode)
- debugger: support restart
- debugger: faster stop when debugging hasn't started yet
- Debug Console now shows all output from WinUAE as well (exceptions, etc.)
- GDB output can now be found in the `Output` pane under `Amiga`
- support IntelliSense for assembly sources (currently working: `Go to Symbol`, `Go to Definition`, semantic highlighting)
- support relocation for an arbitrary number of sections/hunks (fixes [#11](https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug/issues/11))
- support data breakpoints/watchpoints (during debugging, right-click on a variable and select `Break when value changes`)
- support for a custom version of Shrinkler executable cruncher by Blueberry that generates `.shrinklerstats` files that can be opened with VS Code for size profiling. Right-click an EXE file in the explorer, and select `Amiga: Shrinkle File`, then select a Shrinkler configurations. See `.vscode/amiga.json` in the template project for examples of how to specify shrinkler configurations.
- added blitter timeline to profiler
- better scolling/zooming in profiler
- fixed CPU profiling (callstacks got merged)
- GCC: fixed unwind information generated in epilogues
- disassemble ELF file: Right-click on ELF file in the explorer, and select `Amiga: Disassemble ELF File`. Navigate with cursor keys. Automatically opens C sources and relates C source code to assembly. cursor right to follow jump, cursor left to backtrack. Navigate in C sources to automatically show corresponding assembly instructions. Disassembly is automatically updated when you rebuild your project.
- profiler: new `Assembly` tab shows assembly execution trace with timings and jumps
- profiler now has symbol table and can resolve addresses
- profiler now synchronized to DMA
- profiler now supports multiple frames with screenshots
- profiler: optimized loading of big profile files
- fixed blitter crash after setting a breakpoint in interrupt or profiling
- graphics debugger in profiler (copper, blitter, bitmaps, custom registers). Use debug_register_*/debug_unregister functions from `gcc8_c_support.h` to tell the graphics debugger about your bitmaps, palettes and copperlists for a better experience. Move the time slider in the flame-graph to replay the captured frame and see your graphics change in real-time. Use 'Overlay' to visualize blitter rects or overdraw.
- WinUAE debug overlay: debug_text now supports newlines
- several DMA request were not displayed in the timeline (bitplanes > 1, sprites > 1, refresh > 1)
- template project: added ThePlayer61 module replayer. To convert your own modules, use [p61con](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=19922)
- increased buffer size for addr2line.exe (profiling could fail on "big" executables)
- `gcc8_c_support.c`: improved `warpmode`
- IntelliSense: previous versions would write `"compilerPath"` to every `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`, even if it wasn't an Amiga project. Now, the whole process has been simplified. Please use the following `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file:
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Amiga",
            "configurationProvider": "BartmanAbyss.amiga-debug"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
and move the existing `"defines"`, `"includePath"` settings to `.vscode/amiga.json` like this:
```json
{
	"includePath": [ 
		"${workspaceFolder}/**",
		"${workspaceFolder}/../shared/"
	],
	"defines": [ "DEBUG" ]
}
```
`"defines" : [ "__GNUC__=8", "_NO_INLINE" ]` is no longer needed.

**Important:** You must have a `.vscode/amiga.json` file in your workspace, even if it's empty. IntelliSense will not work if this file is not present.
