# _amiga-debug_ Visual Studio Code Extension

**One-stop Visual Studio Code Extention to compile, debug and profile Amiga C/C++ programs compiled by the bundled gcc 13.1 with the bundled WinUAE/FS-UAE and GDB.**

## Overview
This fully self-contained extension will help you to quickly develop demos, intros, games, etc. for the Amiga 500, 1200, 4000. It supports C and C++, however no standard library is available. It comes with advanced productivity features like debug overlay, frame profiler, graphics debugger and size profiler.

## Video
Here's a video showing off all the new features of v1.1, including the frame profiler and graphics debugger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ4tKisnr7Y

## Quick-start
0. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace
1. Create a new empty project folder with `File > Open Folder...`
2. From the command palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> select `Amiga: Init Project`
3. (optional, but recommended)
   - either: open settings <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> and under `Extensions` > `Amiga C/C++ Compile, Debug & Profile` point `Rom-paths: A500` to your *Kickstart 1.3* ROM
   - or: open `.vscode/launch.json` and point `"kickstart"` to your *Kickstart 1.3* ROM
3. Hit <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and run a minimal sample project
4. If you prefer C++ instead of C, just rename `main.c` to `main.cpp`

## Features
- No additional tools required. Everything is included (except Kickstart ROM ðŸ˜’). Ready to go make your next Amiga 500 production!
- State-of-the-art code generation by GCC with Link-Time-Optimizations (LTO) for increased performance and smaller code size
- IntelliSense for C, C++, and assembly (VASM or GAS)
- Full source-level and assembly-level debugging with callstack, breakpoints, data breakpoints (watchpoints), watches, registers, memory view with GDB-enabled WinUAE
- Fully AmigaOS compatible via included .h files
- `INCBIN`, `INCBIN_CHIP` support
- Output to debug console from WinUAE
- WinUAE warp-launch (turbo-boot)
- WinUAE warp-mode control from your Amiga project (speed up precalc during development)
- WinUAE debug overlay, full control from your Amiga project
- Frame Profiler: function-level + DMA cycles profiling (A500, A1200 (PAL) only)
- Graphics Debugger: replay a captured frame cycle by cycle and watch your bitmaps change in real-time; Visualize all blitter operations, bitmap writes, copper list, custom registers (OCS only)
- Size Profiler: profile the size of your executable by functions, data and references
- Shrinkler executable cruncher with size profiling: profile the size of your compressed executable (right-click Amiga EXE files in the explorer)
- Disassembly: Show disassembly of ELF file incl. 68000 cycle count and correlation with source code (right-click Amiga ELF files in the explorer)
- Terminal window with access to the build tools
- Extension automatically mounts executable's directory as `dh1:`, allowing for reading and writing files.

## How-to-use
- `Amiga: View Memory`, `Amiga: Set Force Disassembly`, `Amiga: View Disassembly (Function)` are available from the command palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>
- Use the command `Amiga: Open Terminal` to open a shell with the environment set to use the included tools like `elf2hunk`, `gcc`, `gnumake` etc. (e.g. `gnumake clean`)
- Frame Profiler: function-level + DMA profiling: during a debugging session, press the `Profile` button on the right of the debug toolbar, and 1 frame will be profiled. Press the rightmost button to profile 50 frames. Mark your WaitVBLs etc with calls to `debug_start_idle()` and `debug_stop_idle()` to show correct CPU usage under thumbnails.
- Size Profiler: profile the size of your executable: right-click an ELF file in the Explorer, and select `Amiga: Profile File Size`
- All the profilers write (sometimes rather large) files in your temp directory. If you're low on disk space, use `Amiga: Clean Temp Files`
- WinUAE debug overlay: see debug_* calls in template project's main.c
- WinUAE:
  - <kbd>^</kbd> = single step, <kbd>Pause</kbd> = pause/resume <kbd>Page-up</kbd> = warp mode
  - all necessary options are already configured for Amiga 500, Kickstart 1.3 (for debugging), if you want to change some things (resolution, window size, etc.) just go into the `Configurations` tab, select `default`, and hit `Save`
- some nifty coding helpers in the command palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>
  - `Open Gradient Master`: opens the Deadliner's The Amiga Gradient Master tool to assist you creating color gradients for Copperlists).
  - `Open Image Tool` opens the Deadliner's Image Tool to assist you converting images to different Amiga formats.
  - `Open Color Reducer` opens the Deadliner's Color Reducer tool to assist you reducing the number of colors in images in a smart manner.
  - `Open BLTCON Cheat Sheet`: opens the Deadliner's BLTCON Cheat Sheet tool that helps you designing Blitter operations.
  - `Open Amiga Hardware Reference Manual`: opens the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual TOC hosted at amigadev.elowar.com.

## Caveats
- sometimes when you're multiplying 2 WORDs together, `gcc` tries to use a (slow) 32-bit multiply. So if you have performance-critical multiplications, consider using the `muluw` and `mulsw` functions from `gcc8_c_support.h`

## Contributing
For development, just install the latest [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/), create a new directory, clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug.git`, then install the dependencies with `npm install`. To build, open the directory in VS Code and hit `F5`. You can then test the extension without building a `.vsix`.
To build a `.vsix`, `npm install -g vsce` (once), and then `vsce package`.

## Development (Windows)
Here are the command-lines used to compile the external tools (We're building with MinGW on WSL on Windows 10/11 to `c:\amiga-mingw\opt`).
Replace the `16` in `make -j16` with your number of CPU cores

## Development (Linux/MacOS)
- Have a look at the CI scripts here https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug/tree/master/ci

## Internal Development

### Debugging
- `amigaDebug.ts`: set `DEBUG` to `TRUE` to enable GDB/execution traces
- `profile_editor_provider.ts`: set `DEBUG` to `TRUE` to enable `preact-devtools`

### preact-devtools
```bash
git clone https://github.com/preactjs/preact-devtools.git
npm install
npm run build:inline
<copy dist/inline/* to preact-devtools>
```

WinUAE builds with Visual Studio 2022.

### Create new GCC patch
```bash
diff -ruN gcc-13.1.0 gcc-13.1.0-barto > gcc-barto.patch
```

## Known Issues/TODOs

### Documentation
* TODO: better documentation

### Profiler
* lines of functions seem to be off (see template/main.c: function main)
* TODO: drag across flame-graph to measure durations
* TODO: multi-frame profiling: allow user to select number of frames
* TODO: code lenses: update when display unit changes, when frame changes
* stack sizes > 1024 cause UnwindTable to fail parsing (https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug/issues/35)
* TODO: new DMArecord fields (CIA)

### Savestate Debugger
* TODO: kill winuae/gdb when quitting vscode
* (internal) status of tested savestates
  - `desertdream-dots.uss`: ok
  - `interference-stars.uss`: overdraw not correct
  - `gods.uss`: blitrects' height not correct due to planar layout
  - `shadesbeat.uss`: not showing any bitplanes due to not setting them in copper. TODO: get bitplanes from custom registers
  - `brianthelion-rotozoom.uss`: some blitrects missing
  - `rinkadinkredux-end.uss`: hover over small bits at the right, causes error with 0-sized canvas
  - `rinkadinkredux-rotozoom.uss`: no end detected for multiple blits (frame 2)

### Assembly
* TODO: parser needs to check for comments
* TODO: more...

### Objdump
* TODO: click/follow any addresses

### WinUAE
* execution for A4000 model is very flaky (since 1.2.1)
* TODO: fill memory with $DEAD on startup to better find uninitialized memory bugs
* TODO: debugger: detect more exceptions in a better way (not just setting a single breakpoint at every exception vector)

### Debugger
* memory, disassembly: use VSCode built-in requests; memory: can't get memoryReference to work on WATCH items
* disassembly chokes a bit on newlines
* data breakpoints read/read-write (there doesn't seem to be an UI for this in VSCode)
* store assembly breakpoints in one "virtual" file in breakpointMap (how?!)
* vscode.debug.activeDebugSession is undefined when program is stopped on entry
* not getting handleThreadSelected(), thread ID now set in class
* sometimes Pause/Resume button doesn't correctly switch to "Pause" icon while amiga program is running
* step out of kickstart: set fake breakpoint at 0xfffffff, WinUAE should enter TRACE_RANGE_PC mode (TODO: tighten range around loaded program), but keeps breaking later
* in disassembly view, skipping subroutines with `Step Over` may not work in inlined functions (limitation of GDB)

### Kickstart
* TODO: support multiple vector tables per library (for FPU/non-FPU mathieeesingbas)
* TODO: stack unwinding for kickstart (maybe not necessary)

### Gfx Debugger
* blitter doesn't get pointers if not explicitly written by CPU (e.g. reusing pointers after blit)
* TODO: correctly show blits over 2 frames (second frame is missing blitbox)
* TODO: show source blitter-rects
* TODO: show 2 resources
* TODO: tooltips for blitter-rects?
* Denise: TODO: glitches, blitrects, overdraw, ECS/AGA scrolling, AGA sprites, multi-frame
* Denise: `turrican2-level1.uss`, `desertdream-dots.uss`: sprites 2 pixels too far left
* TODO: AGA colors (256 colors and 24bit)
