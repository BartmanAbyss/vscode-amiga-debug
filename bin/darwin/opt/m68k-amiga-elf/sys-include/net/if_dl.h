/* 
 * A Link-Level Sockaddr may specify the interface in one of two
 * ways: either by means of a system-provided index number (computed
 * anew and possibly differently on every reboot), or by a human-readable
 * string such as "il0" (for managerial convenience).
 * 
 * Census taking actions, such as something akin to SIOCGCONF would return
 * both the index and the human name.
 * 
 * High volume transactions (such as giving a link-level ``from'' address
 * in a recvfrom or recvmsg call) may be likely only to provide the indexed
 * form, (which requires fewer copy operations and less space).
 * 
 * The form and interpretation  of the link-level address is purely a matter
 * of convention between the device driver and its consumers; however, it is
 * expected that all drivers for an interface of a given if_type will agree.
