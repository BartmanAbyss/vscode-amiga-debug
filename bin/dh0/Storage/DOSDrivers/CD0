 * CD-ROM file system entry
 *
 * This file enables the CD-ROM file system which allows you to read standard
 * ISO-9660 CD-ROM disks from an Amiga with a SCSI or IDE controller.
 *
 * The "Unit" line defines the SCSI address of the CD-ROM drive. Drives
 * often come configured as unit 2, which is the default. Check the
 * documentation for your CD-ROM drive to find the exact SCSI address.
 * Note that most drives let you change this number using jumpers.
