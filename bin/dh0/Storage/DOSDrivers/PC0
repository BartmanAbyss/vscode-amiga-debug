 * CrossDOS file system entry
 *
 * This file enables CrossDOS on the built-in floppy drive normally
 * referred to as DF0:. PC1 does the same for DF1. By creating new versions
 * of this file and changing the Unit line to use other numbers, you can
 * make CrossDOS available on other devices. For example, changing the value
 * of Unit to 2 would create a mount file that would enable CrossDOS on DF2.
